The Deodorant Mod is a free and open source mod that adds a new deodorant item
and changes the behavior of mobs depending on whether you have applied deodorant.

⚠️ I am a very new modder and this is a brand-new mod. There is a high likelyhood of there being
multiple bugs and issues with the mod. If you run into any bugs please file an issue in the GitHub repo.

## What is it

The Deodorant mod adds a new deodorant item to the game. In the current release it is only
obtainable through the creative inventory or commands. You will become "stinky" if you
either sleep in a bed, or if it is a new day. Each player will need to use the
deodorant item at the beggining of every day or when they get out of a bed or else there
will be effects given to them.

### When stinky

All entities will have the same movement behavior as when you attack them. They will run around
in panic. This will not overide other behavior unless it usually would. For example if you attack
a pig, it will start running around in panic for 5 seconds, but if you attack a zombie it will
continue to walk towards you. This behavior will still be the same except the stinkyness will not
apply any actual damage to the pig.

All neutral entities will get angry at the player. For example, enderman will attack the player until
the player applies deodorant or dies.

## Installation

You will need the fabric loader installed to load the mod. If you need help installing the mod, check out [this](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install) link.

You can downlaod the latest release from either [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/deodorant-mod) or from [GitHub releases](). I will likely update
this mod as new version of Minecraft come out and include new features, but understand that I am free to
change my mind at any later date.
